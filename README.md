# Cloud-Computing


Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, databases, storage, applications & other IT resources.

## Features:

1. Pay-as-you-go pricing
2. Provide exactly the right type & size of computing resources whenever needed.
3. You can access as many resources as you need almost instantly.
4. The simple way to access the server, storage, database & the set of the application.

## Deployment model of Cloud

- private cloud
- public cloud
- hybrid cloud


## Difference between Public, Private, Hybrid

## Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade capital expenses (CAPEX) for operational expenses (OPEX)
2. Benefit from massive economics of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed & agility
5. Stop spending money running & maintaining the data center
6. Go global in minutes

## Problems Solved By Cloud

1. Flexible: **flexibility is the use of multiple instance types to satisfy capacity requirements.** 
2. Cost Effective: **producing good results without costing a lot of money**.
3. Scalability: **Scalability means that the application/system can handle greater load by adapting. There are two types of scalability** 

           **Vertical    Horizontal**

3 . Elasticity: **The ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them.**

4 .  High availability & fault tolerance: **Run the instance for the same application across the multi-availability zone.**

5 . Agility: **New resources are only a click away which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to the developer from week to minutes. Reduce the deployment time.**

## Types of Cloud Computing

1. On-Premises 
2. IAAS (Infrastructure as a service)
3. PAAS (Platform as a service)
4. SAAS (Software as a service)
